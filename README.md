# Twitter-Sentiment-Classifier


We have provided synthetic (bogus, semi-randomly generated) Twitter data in a csv file named project_twitter_data.csv which contains the text of a tweet, the number of retweets of that tweet, and the number of replies to that tweet. We also have words that express positive sentiment and negative sentiment in the files positive_words.txt and negative_words.txt.

the task is to create a sentiment classifier, which will detect the degree of positive or negative of each tweet. you need to create a csv file, which contains columns for the number of retweets, the number of replies, the positive score (which is the number of happy words in the tweet), the negative score (which is the number of angry words in the tweet), and the net score for each tweet. At the end, we upload the csv file to Excel or Google Sheets and produce a graph of the net score versus the number of retweets.
